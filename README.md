## Goal

> - This project aims to provide people both a hall of shame (blacklist) and a hall of fame (whitelist) of companies during the harsh covid-19 pandemic.
> - Thus empowering people with data to find a new job =)
> - Working without a proven need? **blacklist then!**
> - Working with cool guys? **give them some credit and whitelist them!!**
> - Feel free to contribute sending pull requests.
> - Not a tech/IT guy or not familiar with github? Feel free to [send me](mailto:covid19icu@outlook.com) your request.
> - Totally based on [996.ICU Repo](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU).
> - ICU stands for Intensive Care Unit, it's allusive to the risk of needing ICU due to the new covid-19.
